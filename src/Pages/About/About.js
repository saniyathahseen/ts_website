                    The journey is never about a shot but the unsaid stories within
                    the shooting experience.The quest within is of something which
                    is ‘epiphanic’.

                    As an artist whose medium of bringing the art to the world is an
                    intent of compartmentalising the moments, I am all about things
                    which are not seen by the naked eye but a soul which feels what
                    cannot be said through any other medium.

                  <p>
                    The world is material but I am still looking for a metaphor in
                    it. Anything which can allow me the space to create what is not
                    felt is the domain I am looking for.
